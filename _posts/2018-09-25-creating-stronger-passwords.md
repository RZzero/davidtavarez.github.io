This will a short post because is simple: A secure password and updated recovery info help protect your information. A strong password helps you: to prevent brute force and dictionary login attacks, to prevent your passwords from being hacked by social engineering attempts and most important, it will help you to sleep well :)

I have 5 tips:

- Make your passwords very long.
- Don’t use a common phrase.
- Test your password.
- Don’t reuse your password.
- Use two-factor authentication.

Bonus:

- Use a password manager.
