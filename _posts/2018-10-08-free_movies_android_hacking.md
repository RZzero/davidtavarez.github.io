Who likes free stuff?! I don't know about you guys but I love free stuff. Recently my brother-in-law sent to me a link to download **Bluemax2**, an app for the FireStick that allows people to see movies, series and tv-shows. The author of this App give you a credential for an annual small fee. The app is really stable and the streaming has a very good quality, the best that I've ever seen outside Netflix, Amazon or Youtube. I have trust issue, so I decided to see what this app was doing... 10 minutes later I was watching "Hackers" without paying a dime. ![Hackers][hackers-screenshot]
