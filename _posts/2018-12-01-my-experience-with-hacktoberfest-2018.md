![My Stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidtavarez/davidtavarez.github.io/master/_images/posts/github_hacktoberfest_2018_stats.png)
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio. Five quality pull requests must be submitted to public GitHub repositories, after this you'll receive a cool t-shirt if you're already registered. This year I decided to participate.

I was really inspired after attending to [DerbyCon VIII](https://www.derbycon.com/); since I'm a Python and .NET developer I decided to submit some PRs to [SILENTTRINITY](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/SILENTTRINITY). Also I did update [GlucoLog](https://github.com/davidtavarez/glucolog), a small API focus on keep tracking of glycemia records.

It was a really good decision. I did learn a lot while code in [IronPython](http://ironpython.net/). It was more just than only code, I did learn more about how .NET really works. Because I was submitting Pull Requests to others projects, I focused myself into create good and readable code. The value of the PR submitted should be clear, this helped me to concentrate just in the important stuff.

Another cool thing was that I met smart people with some common interests, for me this is very valuable.

In just a month of coding, I did learn a lot, but also I think **I did became in a better developer**.
