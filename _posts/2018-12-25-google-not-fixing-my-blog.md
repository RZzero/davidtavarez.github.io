**Google** isn’t indexing my blog. When I started writing I decided not to add Google Analytics in this site. I thought that decision wasn’t important but I think I was wrong, it looks like it's important in order to have your site indexed by Google. If you want to add Analytics to your site, you have to add some javascript code. Also, by doing this, you’re allowing Google to share people’s cookies through the whole Internet to track what they do and where they go. So... I'm willing to run this site without Analytics.
