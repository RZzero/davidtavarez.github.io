# [Pinky][pinky-page] - The PHP Mini RAT

**Pinky** is a command line web shell designed for remote administration and pen testing, which helps you to bypass text content filtering and whitelisting applications policies with a minimum effort. It provides a powerfull bash-like console through a PHP agent running on the target, even in restricted environments.
